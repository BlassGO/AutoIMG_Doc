<h2>AutoIMG - Configs</h2>

   > <span style="color: #149DCC; font-weight: bold;">AutoIMG</span> is a tool for Windows, which facilitates multiple command line actions of `adb.exe` and `fastboot.exe`, through a graphical interface and carefully defined function stack to help the user by avoiding critical errors. `Config Scripts` are based on the [DinoCode](https://blassgo.github.io/DinoCode_Doc/ ':ignore') pseudo-language and are intended for creating Scripts that further automate software installations with this tool, taking advantage of every existing feature.
   > 
   > **->** These Scripts are intended for developers.
